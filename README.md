# Wedding Website
A beautiful wedding website that I created for my brothers wedding.


# Getting Started
1. `$ cd wedding-website` - go inside the project directory
2. `$ npm install` - install dependencies _(optional)_
3. That's it, open `index.html` on your browser by just double-clicking on the file.
